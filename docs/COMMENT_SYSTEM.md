   {
       use Commentable;
   }
   ```

## Usage

```blade
<livewire:comments.comments-list :commentable="$model" />
```

### Advanced Usage

```blade
<livewire:comments.comments-list 
    :commentable="$model" 
    :per-page="20"

```

## API Methods

### Comment Model

```php
// Create a comment
$model->addComment('Comment content', $parentId, $userId);

// Get comments
$model->comments() // All comments
$model->approvedComments() // Only approved
$model->topLevelComments() // Only top-level (no replies)

// Check if has comments
$model->hasComments()

// Get comment count
$model->comments_count

// Get nested structure
$model->getNestedComments()
```

### Comment Instance

```php
// Check if reply
$comment->isReply()

// Get depth level
$comment->depth

// Get replies
$comment->replies()

// Approve comment
$comment->approve($approver)
```

## Permissions

The system supports permission-based editing and deletion:

- **Edit**: Users can edit their own comments or if they have the `edit comments` permission
- **Delete**: Users can delete their own comments or if they have the `delete comments` permission
- **Reply**: Authenticated users can reply (limited to 3 levels deep)

## Markdown Support

The comment form includes a formatting toolbar with buttons for:
- **Bold**: `**text**`
- **Italic**: `*text*`
- **Quote**: `> text`
- **Lists**: `- item` or `1. item`
- **Links**: `[text](url)`
- **Code**: `` `code` `` or ``` ```code``` ```

## Reactions

Comments support the same reaction system as other content:
- üëç Like
- üëé Dislike
- üòä Blush
- üçÜ Eggplant
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart
- ü§§ Drool

## Testing

Run the comment system tests:

```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Comments/
```

## Demo

Visit `/app/comments-demo` to see the comment system in action with a sample story.

## Customization

### Styling
The components use Tailwind CSS classes and can be customized by modifying the view files in `resources/views/livewire/comments/`.

### Validation Rules
Modify validation rules in the `CommentForm` component's `rules()` method.

### Permissions
Update permission checks in the `CommentItem` component's `canEdit()` and `canDelete()` methods.

### Markdown Rendering
The system uses Laravel's built-in `Str::markdown()` method. You can customize this by modifying the view files.

## Performance Considerations

- Each comment is its own Livewire component for optimal performance
- Comments are paginated to handle large numbers of comments
- Reactions are cached for better performance
- Nested replies are limited to 3 levels to prevent deep nesting

## Security

- All comment content is validated and sanitized
- CSRF protection is handled by Livewire
- Permission checks prevent unauthorized editing/deletion
- Soft deletes are used for comment removal
