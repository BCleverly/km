# Cursor MCP Configuration for Stripe Integration

## Stripe MCP Server Configuration

This project includes a Stripe MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configuration that allows AI agents to interact with Stripe's API and access Stripe's knowledge base.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Environment Variables**: Make sure your `.env` file contains your Stripe credentials:
   ```
   STRIPE_KEY=your-stripe-publishable-key
   STRIPE_SECRET=your-stripe-secret-key
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-stripe-webhook-secret
   ```

2. **MCP Server**: The Stripe MCP server is configured to run locally using the `@stripe/mcp` package.

3. **Usage**: The MCP server provides tools for:
   - Creating and managing Stripe customers
   - Processing payments and subscriptions
   - Managing products and prices
   - Handling webhooks
   - Accessing Stripe's knowledge base

### Security Notes

- Never expose your Stripe secret keys in client-side code
- Use webhook secrets to verify event authenticity
- Use Stripe's test mode for development and testing
- Ensure appropriate permissions for your Stripe account
