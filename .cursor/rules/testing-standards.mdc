- Verify authentication and authorization
- Test response formats and status codes
- Test error handling

## Livewire Testing

- Test user interactions
- Test validation rules
- Test real-time updates

## Performance Testing
- Test database query performance

- Test memory usage
- Use browser testing for critical flows

## Test Commands
